            Many origami creators use creative ways to describe how a piece of paper should be folded.
             The list here is generally accepted by most origami artists. See this article for more details.</p>

                Fold the top-edge of the paper down while you push the right and left edges inwards. Step 3a shows the transition step. Use the location of the red dot to help visualize the process.
                Done! The origami waterbomb base looks like an isosceles triangle with a total of 4 flaps. The typical orientation is to have the flaps arranged two on each side. Some models might have all 4 flaps stacked on one side, or the flaps may be flared open like a star.

                Fold the paper along the diagonal in both directions to form a X-shaped crease. Unfold. Flip the paper over.
                Perform the blintz fold (fold the four corners towards the center of the paper). Unfold. Turn the paper over: step 5a shows the crease pattern. You are now ready to collapse the paper into a windmill base;
                Refold the crease located ¼ of the distance from the bottom edge of the paper. At the same time, refold the crease located ¼ of the way from the right edge of the paper.
                An extra flap of paper will be formed. Swivel this extra flap of paper towards the right. Alternatively, you can swivel the flap downwards, but you have to be consistent as to which direction to fold subsequent flaps.
                Rotate the paper clockwise 90 degrees.
                Repeat the process by refolding the crease ¼ from the right edge of the paper. A second flap will be formed: swivel it towards the right.
                Rotate the paper clockwise 90 degrees.
                Repeat the process one last time: valley fold the bottom layer ¼ from the right edge of the paper. This forms two more flaps, swivel the lower flap towards the right and top flap upwards.
