                    <P class="firstH-content-mid-1-item-content" >Paper is a thin nonwoven material traditionally made 
                        from a combination of milled plant and textile fibres. It is primarily used for writing, artwork, 
                        and packaging; it is commonly white. The first papermaking process was documented in China during 
                        the Eastern Han period traditionally attributed to the court official Cai Lun. During 
                        the 8th century, Chinese papermaking spread to the Islamic world, where pulp mills and paper mills
                        were used for papermaking and money making. By the 11th century, papermaking was brought to Europe.
                        By the 13th century, papermaking was refined with paper mills utilizing waterwheels in Spain. 
                        Later European improvements to the papermaking process came in the 19th century with the invention
                        of wood-based papers. Although precursors such as papyrus and amate existed in the Mediterranean
                        world and pre-Columbian Americas, respectively,these materials are not defined as true paper.</P>

                     prepared animal skin that predates paper and possibly papyrus. In the twentieth century with 
                     the advent of plastic manufacture some plastic "paper" was introduced, as well as paper-plastic 
                     laminates, paper-metal laminates, and papers infused or coated with different products that give 
                     them special properties.

                    meaning to fold, and "kami", meaning paper. Until recently, not all forms of paper folding were grouped under the word origami.

                a few suggestions that they originated in China 2000 years ago, but actually this does not seem correct. Because this view is 
                suggested by the idea that Origami was born after paper, but there is no evidence to confirm this either. And the sheets of 
                後 漢 didn't show Origami's shape.</p>
            <p class="thirdH-content-mid-content">Distinct paperfolding traditions arose in Europe, China, and Japan which have been 
                well-documented by historians. These seem to have been mostly separate traditions, until the 20th century.Japanese origami began 
                sometime after Buddhist monks carried paper to Japan during the 6th century. The first Japanese origami dates from this period
                 and was used for religious ceremonial purposes only, due to the high price of paper.</p>

                Saikaku in 1680 which mentions a traditional butterfly design used during Shinto weddings. Folding filled some ceremonial functions
                 in Edo period Japanese culture; noshi were attached to gifts, much like greeting cards are used today. This developed into a form 
                 of entertainment; the first two instructional books published in Japan are clearly recreational.</p>

                paradigm. The folding sequences of modern origami are regarded as "models" "designed" by "origami creators."

            <p class="fourth-content-mid-content">In 1950s and 60s, an international origami circle was established by creators and folders such as
                 Yoshizawa Akira, Takahama Toshie, Honda Isao, Robert Harbin, Gershon Legman, Lillian Oppenheimer, Samuel Randlett, Vicente 
                 Solórzano-Sagredo, and so forth. They have advanced popularization of origami through their community.

                        Origami not only covers still-life, there are also moving objects; Origami can move in clever ways. Action origami includes
                         origami that flies, requires inflation to complete, or, when complete, uses the kinetic energy of a person's hands, applied at
                          a certain region on the model, to move another flap or limb. Some argue that, strictly speaking, only the latter is really 
                          "recognized" as action origami. Action origami, first appearing with the traditional Japanese flapping bird, is quite common. 
                          One example is Robert Lang's instrumentalists; when the figures' heads are pulled away from their bodies, their hands will move, 
                          resembling the playing of music.

                        Modular origami consists of putting a number of identical pieces together to form a complete model. Normally the individual
                         pieces are simple but the final assembly may be tricky. Many of the modular origami models are decorative balls like kusudama, 
                         the technique differs though in that kusudama allows the pieces to be put together using thread or glue. Chinese paper folding 
                         includes a style called Golden Venture Folding where large numbers of pieces are put together to make elaborate models. 
                         This style originated from some Chinese refugees while they were detained in America.

                        Wet-folding is an origami technique for producing models with gentle curves rather than geometric straight folds and flat surfaces. 
                        The paper is dampened so it can be moulded easily, the final model keeps its shape when it dries. It can be used, for instance,
                         to produce very natural looking animal models. Size, an adhesive that is crisp and hard when dry, but dissolves in water when wet
                          and becoming soft and flexible, is often applied to the paper either at the pulp stage while the paper is being formed, or on the
                           surface of a ready sheet of paper. The latter method is called external sizing and most commonly uses Methylcellulose, or MC, paste,
                            or various plant starches.
